MARTINI Lipid Bilayer system

Set up with 2 replicas with large overlap over constant large energy range.
Replica 1- Tlo=200, Thi=500
Replica 2- Tlo=210, Thi=510

Initial estimate of the statisical temperature (Y2 array in fix_stmd) is given
with full restart file in oREST.*.d-save.

oREST.*.d contains the ending configuration for each replica as well as all
necessary restart parameters. To repeat the simulation as in this folder,
oREST.*.d-save should be copied to replace oREST.*.d

NOTE/DISCLAIMER: A 2-d periodic strucutre like a lipid bilayer in a NVT
algorithm produces strange results like holes or compressions. These results
maybe unphysical but the small system size and strong phase transition makes it
an optimal 2-replica system.
